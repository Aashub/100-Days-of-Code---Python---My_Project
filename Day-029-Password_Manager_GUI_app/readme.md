# Day 29 - Password Manager GUI App

## Project Overview
 This project is a **Password Manager** app using **Python’s Tkinter library**, which introduced me to building real-world GUI applications that are not only interactive but also practical for daily use. In this  **Password Manager GUI App** user can Generate **strong, complex passwords** that are hard to crack and Save those passwords along with the **website/platform name** and **email/username** in a `.txt` file so they don't have to be remembered and can use them later. In order to create this project i have learned about how to use pyperclip library for auto copy the generated password, Tkinter class, revised and implemented how to use list comprehension and file handling in python

## What I Have Learned

* I learned how to build an interactive GUI using Python's Tkinter library. To begin with, I used Tk() to create the main window where everything appears. Then I added static text using Label() and used Entry() for input fields where the user can type their website, email, and password.

* To make the interface functional, I used Button() class to trigger specific actions like generating or saving a password. I added a logo to the window using Canvas() and PhotoImage() which allowed me to display an image (logo.png) in the GUI.

* To handle user interactions smartly I have learned about how ot use a  messagebox.showinfo() to notify users when they leave fields empty, and messagebox.askokcancel() to confirm the details before saving. This added a layer of error prevention and better UX.

* Also I have revised and implemented the use of list comprehensions for generating a mix of letters, symbols, and numbers to create a password. Then I learned ow to use .join() to combine them into one string. I also learned how to automatically copy the password to clipboard using pyperclip.copy().

* Lastly, I used .get() to access values typed by the user, .insert() to preload the email field with a default value, and .delete() to clear fields after saving. Overall.

## How It Works 

* **User Interface Setup**: A window is created using `Tk()` class, and widgets like labels, input fields, and buttons are arranged using `.grid()`.

* **Input Fields**:The user types the website/platform name, their email or username, and either their own password or clicks on **“Generate Password”** to auto-generate one.

* **Generating a Password**: When the **Generate Password** button is clicked A strong password is created using geneate password function that randoms letters, numbers, and symbols via list comprehension and created a strong password. The password is displayed in the password field and automatically copied to the clipboard to use it.

* **Validation & Saving the Data**: If any input field is empty and the user tries to save, a **pop-up alert** appears saying not to leave fields empty. When all fields are filled and the **Add** button is clicked a confirmation pop-up appears showing all the input details. If the user clicks OK, the details are saved to a `data.txt` file. The input fields are then cleared for the next entry.

## Project Highlights

* Built the GUI application
* Revised how to use list comprehension.
* learned how to use, User-friendly field validation and pop-up messages.
* Revised myself about how open() and write() a file. 
* Real-world utility app that actually helps manage passwords.
