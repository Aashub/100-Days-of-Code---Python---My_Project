# Day 9 - Blind Auction Project

## Project Overview
The Blind Auction project is a console-based application that simulates a bidding system where participants can place anonymous bids. This project helped me practice and reinforce concepts like dictionaries, loops, conditionals, and reusable functions.

## How It Works
- The program starts by displaying an ASCII logo from the art module.
- It prompts the user to enter their name and bid amount, which is stored in a dictionary.
- It then asks whether there are more bidders. If **yes**, the screen is cleared and the next bidder enters their details. If **no**, the program compares all bids and announces the highest bidder as the winner.

## Code Highlights
- Used a **dictionary** to store user names as keys and their bids as values.
- Applied **recursion** to keep asking for bidders until the bidding ends.
- Determined the highest bidder using a **for loop** that compares all the bids.
- Displayed the final result with the winner's name and bid amount.

This project was a great way to apply Python basics to a real-world scenario and understand how data can be collected and evaluated through user interaction.
