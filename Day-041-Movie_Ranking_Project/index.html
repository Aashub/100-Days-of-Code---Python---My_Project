<h1>Best Picks According To Asteroid Destroyer.</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>I love Fight Club because it feels like it’s saying out loud all the frustration, emptiness, and rebellion a lot of us secretly feel about modern life.</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>I love it because it makes you feel small and emotional at the same time mixing science, time, love, and sacrifice in a way that really sticks with you.</p>

<h3>Better Days</h3>
<p>I like it because it feels painfully real, showing how pressure, bullying, and loneliness can break someone, but also how one human connection can still save you.</p>


<h2>My top 3 Anime of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>I love it because it’s not just an adventure it’s about freedom, dreams, and chosen family, and somehow it keeps hitting harder the longer it goes on.</p>

<h3>Naruto Shippuden</h3>
<p>I like it because it shows how pain, loneliness, and hard work shape a person, and how never giving up can slowly change everything.</p>

<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>I love it because it starts like a survival story but turns into a brutal question about freedom, war, and whether anyone is really right or wrong.</p>


<h2>My top 3 Web Series of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>I love it because no one is safe, power always has a price, and every choice feels heavy with consequences.</p>

<h3>Dark</h3>
<p>I like it because it makes you feel small time, fate, and family are so tangled that you start questioning free will itself.</p>

<h3>Money Heist</h3>
<p>I love it because it turns a robbery into a mind game, where emotions, chaos, and clever plans keep colliding nonstop.</p>
