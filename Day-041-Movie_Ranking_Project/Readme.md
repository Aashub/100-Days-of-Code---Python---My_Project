# Day 41 – Movie Ranking Project

## Project Overview

This project is a simple HTML webpage as it was the starting of my website design learning where I have learned about what is html, what is heading tag <h1></h1> and how many types of heading tag are their, paragraph tag <p></p>, <hr/> horizontal tag, <br/> break tag by using this tag I have built the static webpage where I have listed my personal favorite movies, anime, and web series of all time. The goal of this project was to practice basic HTML structure and tags while presenting content in a clean and readable way.

## What I Have Learned

* **HTML Headings**: Learned how to use heading tags like <h1></h1>, <h2></h2>, and <h3></h3> to structure content properly and what is hierarchy to use them.

* **Paragraph Tag**: : Learned about how to use the <p> tag to write descriptions and keep text readable.

* **Horizontal Rule**: Learned how to use <hr /> horizontal rule to visually separate different sections on the webpage.

* **Break Tag**: Learned how to use <br/> break tag to break line and spacing between elements.

* **Void Tag**: Learned that some HTML tags do not have closing tags because in this tag their is no need to add content therefore do not require a closing tag and that's why they known as void tags, such as <br /> and <hr />.

* **Non Void Tag**: Learned that most HTML tags come with opening and closing tags, known as non-void tags, such as <h1></h1> and <p></p>.

## How It Works

* **Main Heading**: The <h1> tag is used for the main heading title of the webpage.

* **Section Headings:**: The <h2> tags divide the content into Movies, Anime, and Web Series sections.

* **Titles and Descriptions**: Each item name like move, web series and anime is written using <h3> and followed by a <p> tag describing why I like it.

* **Spacing and Separation**: <hr /> is used to separate sections clearly.

## Project Highlights
