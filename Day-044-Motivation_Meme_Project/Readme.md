# Day 44 – Motivational Poster Project

## Project Overview

This project is a simple HTML and CSS based static webpage where I practiced using CSS to style and position elements on a webpage. In this project, I focused on layout alignment like padding, margin, border, text styling, image styling, and using external resources like Google Fonts. The webpage displays a motivational meme image along with a heading and a quote, styled to look clean and centered. The main goal of this project was to understand how CSS properties affect layout, typography, and visual presentation.

## What I Have Learned


* **CSS Font Properties**: Learned how to style text using font-related properties such as `font-size` to control text size, `font-weight` to control thickness, and `font-family` to apply custom fonts like Libre Baskerville.
* **CSS Inspection**: Learned how to inspect HTML and CSS using browser developer tools to understand how styles are applied and to debug layout and styling issues.
* **CSS Box Model**: Learned about the CSS box model and how elements are made up of content, padding, border, and margin, and how margin, padding, and border affect spacing and layout.
* **Div Tag**: Learned how to use the `<div></div>` tag as a container to group multiple HTML elements together and apply styling and alignment to them using CSS.

## How It Works

* **HTML Structure**: The webpage uses standard HTML structure starting with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, followed by `<html></html>`, `<head></head>`, and `<body></body>`.
* **External CSS Linking:**: The CSS file is connected using the `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />` tag inside the `<head></head>` section.
* **Main Container**: A `<div></div>` with the ID image_prop is used to wrap the image, heading, and quote and center-align all content so the content look properly.
* **Image Display**: The meme image is displayed using the `<img />` tag and styled with a white border using CSS.
* **Heading Text**: The main heading is displayed using the `<h1></h1>` tag and styled to be uppercase, white in color, and larger in size.
* **Quote Tex**: The quote is displayed using the `<p></p>` tag and styled with white color and a readable font size.

## Project Highlights

* Learned how to center content and control layout using CSS
* learned about the css inspection that we can use  browser developer tools to understand how styles are applied and to debug layout and styling issues.
