# Day 6 - Reborg's World Maze Challenge

## What I Learned
- **Functions**: Created reusable blocks of code to simplify the solution.
- **Code Blocks**: Organized the logic for better readability and efficiency.
- **While Loop**: Used to repeatedly check conditions and navigate through the maze.

## Project Overview
- The Reborg's World Maze Challenge presents a robot (Reborg) that appears at a random location in the maze, facing a random direction.
- The goal is to guide Reborg to the finish line using logical instructions.

## How It Works
- Implemented **while loops** to keep the robot moving until it reaches the finish line.
- Used **functions** to break down the movements into structured steps.
- Leveraged **built-in functions** of Reborgâ€™s World to handle obstacles and directions dynamically.

## Code Highlights
- **Solved Hurdle 3 and Hurdle 4 using the same code without any modifications.**
- The logic was structured in a way that it could adapt to both challenges seamlessly.

This challenge helped me strengthen my understanding of loops, functions, and problem-solving in Python!
