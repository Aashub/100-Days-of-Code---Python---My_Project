# Day 7 - Hangman Project 

## Project Overview
The Hangman Project is a word-guessing game where players try to guess a randomly chosen word one letter at a time to win the Game if He didn't Guess all the letter in the given 6 lifes He Lost the Game. This project incorporates all the Python skills learned so far, including loops, functions, conditionals, and string manipulation.

## How It Works
- The program randomly selects a word from a predefined word list.
- A list containing underscores (`_`) representing the unguessed letters Another list is created containing the actual characters of the chosen word
- The player inputs a letter to guess.
- If the letter is correct, it replaces the corresponding underscore in the displayed w ord.If the letter is incorrect, the player loses a life.
- The game continues until The player correctly guesses all letters (Wins the game 🎉). if The player loses all six lives (Game over ❌).

## Code Highlights
- Uses `random` to select words dynamically.
- Implements `"".join(map(str, list))` for efficient string concatenation.
- Tracks player progress and updates the displayed word in real-time.
- Includes a life counter to limit incorrect guesses.


This project was a great challenge and helped reinforce my Python fundamentals!
