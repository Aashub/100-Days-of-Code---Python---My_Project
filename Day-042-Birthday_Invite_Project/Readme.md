# Day 42 – Birthday Invite Project

## Project Overview

This project is a simple HTML static webpage created as part of my early website design learning. In this project, I built a Birthday Invitation webpage where I learned how to structure content using basic HTML tags like headings, lists, images, and links. The webpage displays a birthday message, date, items to bring using lists, an image of a cake, and a Google Maps link for location. The main goal of this project was to practice HTML list elements, anchor tags, image elements, and understand how content is organized in a static webpage.

## What I Have Learned

* **Unordered List**: Learned how to use `<ul></ul>` with `<li></li>` elements to display a list of items in bullet point format, such as items to bring to a birthday party.

* **Ordered List**: : Learned that when we use `<ol></ol> with` `<li></li>` elements, it displays list items in a numbered sequence format.

* **Nested List**: Learned about nested lists in HTML where we can place an unordered list or ordered list inside another list tag to create sub-lists for better structure.

* **Anchor Tag**: Learned how to use the `<a></a>` anchor tag to add links, so when someone clicks on text or image, they get redirected to another webpage, such as Google Maps location.

* **Image Element**: Learned how to use the `<img />` element to add images to a webpage using the "src" attribute, and how the "alt" attribute helps describe the image for accessibility, especially for visually impaired users

* **HTML Boilerplate**: Learned about the basic HTML boilerplate structure which includes `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html></html>`, `<head></head>`, and `<body></body>` tags. This boilerplate is required to tell the browser that the document is an HTML5 document and to properly structure metadata and webpage content.

## How It Works

* **Main Heading**: The `<h1>` tag is used to display the main birthday announcement on the webpage.

* **Date Section:**: The `<h2>` tag is used to show the birthday date clearly under the main heading.

* **Image Display**: The `<img />` element displays a birthday cake image, and the "alt" attribute describes the image content for accessibility.

* **List of Items**: The `<ul></ul>` unordered list along with `<li></li>` elements shows what guests should bring to the birthday party in bullet point format.

* **Location Link**: The `<a></a>` anchor tag is used to provide a clickable Google Maps link so users can easily find the party location.

## Project Highlights

* Learned how to use unordered lists, anchor tags, and image elements 
* Improved understanding of accessibility using the "alt" attribute
