# Day 8 - Caesar Cipher Project

## Project Overview
The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption tool that shifts letters in a message based on user input. It works by moving each letter forward or backward in the alphabet by a set number of places, making it a great way to understand basic encryption concepts.

## How It Works
- The user provides three inputs: **Direction** (encode or decode), **Shift** (number of positions to move), and **Text** (the message to encrypt or decrypt).
- If "encode" is selected, the program shifts letters forward; if "decode" is selected, it shifts letters backward.
- The program keeps running until the user decides to exit.
- After each encryption or decryption, the user gets a prompt: *The user is prompted to decide whether to continue or exit the program.*

## Code Highlights
- Used Python’s `index()` function to find a letter’s position in the alphabet.
- Explored **positional arguments** and **keyword arguments** to improve function flexibility.
- Learned how to use the **modulo operator** to shift a letter after it reaches the last index in a list.

This project was a great way to practice working with functions, loops, and string manipulation while learning how simple ciphers work!
