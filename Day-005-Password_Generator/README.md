# Day 5 - Password Generator

## What I Learned
- **For Loops**: Used to repeat actions efficiently.
- **Range Function**: Helped generate sequences of numbers easily.
- **Code Blocks**: Organized code for better readability and execution.

## Project Overview
- Built a Password Generator that creates two types of passwords:
  - **Strong Password:** A completely random mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
  - **Sequence Password:** A structured password where letters come first, followed by numbers, then symbols.

## How It Works
- The user enters how many letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password.
- The program generates:
  - **Strong Password:** A random arrangement of characters.
  - **Sequence Password:** Characters arranged in a fixed order.

## Code Highlights
- **`random.choice()`**: Selects random characters from a list.
- **For Loops**: Automate password generation and improve code efficiency.

This project helped me understand how to generate secure passwords while reinforcing my knowledge of loops and randomization in Python!
